Very crude location spoofing Python script using the Twitter API. Like a lot of my projects, this isn't the nicest looking script, but it gets the job done...
TODO: Add location lookup instead of manually adding in the latitude and longitude. Also, work to integrate this into existing scripts (Snake Charmer) as an optional feature.
